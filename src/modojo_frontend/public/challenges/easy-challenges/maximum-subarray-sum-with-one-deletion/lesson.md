# Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion
## Problem

Given an array of integers, return the maximum sum for a non-empty subarray (contiguous elements) with at most one element deletion. In other words, you want to choose a subarray and optionally delete one element from it so that there is still at least one element left and the sum of the remaining elements is maximum possible.

Note that the subarray needs to be non-empty after deleting one element.

## Example

```plaintext

Input: [1,-2,0,3]

Output: 4

```

## Constraints

* The length of the array is positive and will not exceed 10^4

* The values of the array elements are in the range of [-10^5, 10^5]

## Hints

* Try to use dynamic programming to solve this problem

* You can solve this problem in a single pass
