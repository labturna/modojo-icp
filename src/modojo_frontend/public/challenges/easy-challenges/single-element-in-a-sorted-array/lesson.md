# Single Element in a Sorted Array
## Problem

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

## Example

```plaintext

Input: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8]

Output: 2

```

## Constraints

* The length of the array is positive and will not exceed 10^4

* The values of the array elements are in the range of -10^4 to 10^4

## Hints

* Try to use binary search to solve this problem

* You can solve this problem in O(log n) time complexity
