# Longest Palindromic Substring
## Problem

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

## Example

```plaintext

Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

```

## Constraints

* The length of the string is at most 1000

* There is only one longest palindromic substring

## Hints

* Try to use dynamic programming to solve this problem

* You can solve this problem in O(n^2) time complexity

* Try to use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem
