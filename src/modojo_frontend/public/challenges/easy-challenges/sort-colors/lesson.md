# Sort Colors
## Problem

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

## Example

```plaintext

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]

Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

```

## Constraints

* The length of the array is positive and will not exceed 10^4

* The values of the array elements are in the range of 0 to 2

## Hints

* Try to use the Dutch National Flag algorithm to solve this problem

* You can solve this problem in a single pass

* Try to use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem
