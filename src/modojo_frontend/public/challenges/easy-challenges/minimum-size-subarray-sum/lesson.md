# Minimum Size Subarray Sum
## Problem

Given an array of positive integers, find the minimum size of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to a given number. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

## Example

```plaintext

Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint
```

## Constraints

* The length of the array is positive and will not exceed 10^4

* The values of the array elements are in the range of 1 to 10^5

## Hints

* Try to use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem
