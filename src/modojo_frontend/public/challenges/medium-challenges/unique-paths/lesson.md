# Unique Paths  
## Problem 

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Function Signature:

```motoko

public func uniquePaths(_ m: Int, _ n: Int) -> Int;

```

```plaintext

Input:

m (Int): An integer representing the number of rows.

n (Int): An integer representing the number of columns.

Output:

Int: Returns the number of unique paths.

```

## Examples

### Example 1:

```motoko

uniquePaths(3, 7) // 28

```

### Example 2:

```motoko

uniquePaths(3, 2) // 3

```

### Example 3:

```motoko

uniquePaths(7, 3) // 28

```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= m, n <= 100

- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^9.

- A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

- The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
