Generic types, often just referred to as generics, allow you to write flexible, reusable code by defining a common template for various data types. This means you can create data structures or functions that can operate on different types, specified at the point of use, rather than hard-coding them for specific data types.

This might seem a little bit abstract, so let's look at a concrete example. Imagine that you want to create a list structure that can hold any type of data. Initial implementation supporting only one type might look like this:

```motoko
class MyList() {

  let items: [Nat];

  public func add(item : Nat) {
    // ...
  };

  public func remove(item : Nat) {
    // ...
  };

};
```

One way to allow the list to hold any type of data is to use the `Any` type for items:

```motoko
class MyList() {

  let items: [Any];

  public func add(item : Any) {
    // ...
  };

  public func remove(item : Any) {
    // ...
  };

};
```

This works, but now you can actually mix various types in one list, which is often not what you want. Also, when you retrieve an item from the list, you have to cast it to the correct type, which you might not know or remember.

Generic types allow you to create a list that can hold any type of data, but you have to specify which type when you create the list:

```motoko
class MyList<T>() {

  let items: [T];

  public func add(item : T) {
    // ...
  };

  public func remove(item : T) {
    // ...
  };

};
```

The `<T>` after the class name is a placeholder for the type parameter. When you create an instance, you have to specify which type you want to use for `T`:

```motoko
let listOfTexts = MyList<Text>();
let listOfNumbers = MyList<Nat>();
```

Now, the `listOfText` can only hold `Text` values and `listOfNumbers` only `Nat` values. If you try to add something else in the list, you will get compile-time error:

```motoko
listOfTexts.add(1); // Error: type mismatch
```

## Exercise

On the right you have a class `Pair` that holds two values of the `Text` type. Make this class generic, so it can hold pairs of any type.

Then create variable pair2 that holds a pair of two numbers.
