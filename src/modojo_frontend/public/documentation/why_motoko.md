# Why Motoko?

ICP supports programs written in different languages. The only requirement is that the program must support compilation to WebAssembly code. WebAssembly is a low-level computer instruction format for virtual machines. Because WebAssembly code is designed to provide portable low-level instructions that enable applications to be deployed on many platforms such as the web, it is a natural fit for deploying applications that are intended to run on ICP. However, most of the higher-level languages that support compiling to WebAssembly are either unsafe or complex for developers who want to deliver secure applications without a long learning curve.

To address the need for correctness without complexity, DFINITY has designed its own Motoko programming language. Motoko provides a simple and expressive alternative to other programming languages that is easy to learn whether you are a new or experienced programmer.
