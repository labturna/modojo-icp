# Motivation and Goals

Motoko strives to be a simple and useful language for ICP smart contracts that uses a familiar syntax that incorporates the actor model. Motoko offers seamless integration for ICP features and makes the most out of WebAssembly's present and future functionalities.

Motoko is not, and is not intended to be, the only language for implementing canister smart contracts. Canister development kits exist for Rust, TypeScript, Python, and soon Solidity. ICP's goal is to enable any language to be able to produce canister smart contracts by compiling the canister source code into WebAssembly.

However, its tailored design means Motoko should be the easiest and safest language for coding on ICP.
