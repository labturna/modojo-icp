Actors interact with the outside world through messages. These messages are handled by actors via defined async functions. Given that messages are transmitted over the network, there are certain restrictions on the types that can be used for the parameters and return values of these functions.

Motoko limits you to using the so-called **shared types** in the public functions of actors:

- Shared types are always immutable.
- They include primitive values (`Nat`, `Int`, `Float`, `Text`, ...)
- They include tuples, records, variants, and arrays of shared types.

If you use a non-shared type in a public function of an actor, the compiler will complain:

```
type error [M0032], shared function has non-shared return type
```

## Exercise

Code on the right does not compile. Fix it.
