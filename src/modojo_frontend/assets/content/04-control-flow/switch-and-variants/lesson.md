Switch becomes quite useful when used together with [Variants](../variants):

```motoko
type Day = {#Sun; #Mon; #Tue; #Wed; #Thu; #Fri; #Sat};

func toText(d : Day) : Text {
  switch d {
    case (#Sun) "Sunday";
    case (#Mon) "Monday";
    case (#Tue) "Tuesday";
    case (#Wed) "Wednesday";
    case (#Thu) "Thursday";
    case (#Fri) "Friday";
    case (#Sat) "Saturday"
  }
};

toText(#Thu);
```

The switch expression must be exhaustive, i.e., it must cover all possible values of the variant type:

```motoko
type Day = {#Sun; #Mon; #Tue; #Wed; #Thu; #Fri; #Sat};

func toText(d : Day) : Text {
  // fails with `this switch does not cover value ...`
  switch d {
    case (#Sun) "Sunday";
    case (#Mon) "Monday"
  }
};
```

What makes switch truly powerful is **pattern matching**. Recall that a variant type can hold a value. In Motoko, this is often used to represent the result of some operation:

```motoko
type Result = {
  #ok : Nat;
  #err : Text;
};

let resultOk : Result = #ok(42);
let resultErr : Result = #err("Something went wrong");
```

With pattern matching, we can easily extract the value from the variant:

```motoko
let result = doSomething();

switch (result) {
  case (#ok(n)) D.print("ok" # debug_show(n));
  case (#err(msg)) D.print("Failed: " # msg);
};
```

## Exercise

Complete the implementation of the `processResult function. This function should print one of the following messages:

- `Operation successful, received: ` followed by the number
- `Operation failed with error: ` followed by the error message.
